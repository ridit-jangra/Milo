# Milo

A tiny cat that lives in your terminal.

You talk to it. It writes code, reads files, runs commands, searches the web, and remembers things across sessions. It also gains XP, levels up, and gets sad if you don't feed it.

---

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @ridit/milo
```

Or with bun:

```bash
bun add -g @ridit/milo
```

Then run:

```bash
milo
```

On first launch, run `/provider add` to configure your AI provider.

---

## What it does

Milo runs as an interactive CLI with three modes:

**Agent** — full access. reads files, writes code, runs commands, fixes bugs. this is the default.

**Chat** — read-only. answers questions, explains code, searches the web. no changes to your files.

**Plan** — spawns multiple parallel agents to tackle large tasks. good for "build me an auth system" type prompts.

Switch modes with `ctrl+t` or `/mode agent | chat | plan`.

## Providers

Milo supports multiple AI providers:

- **Groq** — fast inference
- **OpenAI** — gpt-4o and friends
- **Anthropic** — claude
- **Ollama** — local models, no API key needed

Add a provider:

```
/provider add
```

Switch mid-session:

```
/provider use <name>
```

Remove a provider:

```
/provider remove
```

Provider configs and API keys are stored at `~/.milo/providers.json`.

## The cat

Milo has a pet system. every tool call earns XP. level up to unlock commands and make milo progressively more unhinged.

- level 3 — `/roast` unlocked
- level 5 — `/vibe` unlocked
- level 10 — `/crimes` unlocked
- level 6+ — full feral mode

milo gets hungry over time. run `/feed` or it gets sad.

---

## Memory

Milo remembers things across sessions. global preferences live at `~/.milo/memory/MEMORY.md`. project-specific context lives in `MILO.md` at your project root — run `/init` to generate it.

## Built with

- [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai) — model routing and tool calling
- [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) — React for CLIs
